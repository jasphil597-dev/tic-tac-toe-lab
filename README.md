Overview
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking a square in a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. This implementation features a simple and responsive web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

    Players can click on squares to place their marks (X or O).
Dynamic Board: 
    The game board is responsive and adjusts based on the screen size.
Win/Tie Detection: 
    The game detects when a player wins or if the game ends in a tie.
Reset Functionality: 
    Players can reset the game with a single button click.

Welcome Message: 
    A modal welcoming players before the game starts.
